Experienced software engineer with 15+ years of experience operating and developing *distributed systems*, *performance optimization*, *infrastructure*, and *fullstack web development*. Operations-focused mindset with focus on minimizing system failure modes, reducing operational overhead, and improving code quality. 

I like to make things go _fast_, _safely_.
