I was browsing the Pragmatic Bookshelf and this book caught my eye: [writing a ray tracer from ground up with a test
driven approach](https://pragprog.com/book/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge)? This sounds like a fantastic challenge
to me. I always was interested in ray tracers but always
thought it too complicated a topic to do it myself. However, test driven development has helped me work on some
complex and terrible code bases, so this feels reassuring to me.

So far I only had the chance to read the first 5 pages and was surprised that the book uses cucumber tests. They
look a bit odd to someone that is used to xunit style tests, but I've managed to get the basics going with
[cucumber-rust](https://github.com/bbqsrc/cucumber-rust). I don't know how much time I can commit to this because the
baby keeps us quite busy, but I hope I can spend maybe a few hours a week on this. Really excited to render my
first photo realistic sphere or [teapot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_teapot).
