I recently realized the docker container for my toy project [`books`](https://sr.ht/~ilikeorangutans/books/) has over 2k downloads so I finally decided to write
some proper docs for it. There's not much to document, but it deserves a nice webpage. Picked up
[`mkdocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/) because I saw it used by some other projects and I'm positively surprised. You
initialize a project and throw some markdown files at it. Then you run `build` and it gives you a nice webpage for your
docs, nothing more, nothing less. Great little tool, highly recommend it.

The documentation for `books` is available under [ilikeorangutans.github.io/books/](https://ilikeorangutans.github.io/books/)
