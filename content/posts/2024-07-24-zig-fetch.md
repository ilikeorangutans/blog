Zig's package manager is still a bit rough. It only supports fetching tarballs, but many github projects don't have them unless they have a release. There's a [trick to fetch any commit as a tarball though](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/github-download-tarball):

```
https://api.github.com/repos/<repo-owner>/<repo>/tarball/<ref>
```

`zig fetch` can than download the code:

```
zig fetch --save https://api.github.com/repos/<repo-owner>/<repo>/tarball/<ref>
```

Once the code is downloaded, it still has to be added to your exe or libray in `build.zig`:

```zig
    const exe = b.addExecutable(.{
        .name = "zlox",
        .root_source_file = b.path("src/main.zig"),
        .target = target,
        .optimize = optimize,
    });

    const my_dep = b.dependency(
      "<name of dependency>", 
      .{ .target = target, .optimize = optimize },
    );
    exe.root_module.addImport("regex", regex_dep.module("regex"));
```
