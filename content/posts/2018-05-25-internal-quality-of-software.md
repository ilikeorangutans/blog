Goal: describe internal quality

## Introduction



## A Tale of Every Software Project

1. Observation: what seems to happen in a lot of projects - internal quality deteriorates, changes become harder and longer, people do not want to touch code
1. The classic excuse: "but it works"! there's actually a lot to it.

describe symptoms of deteriorating software quality in every project you've been in: hard to change code, frequent failures on releases/deploys, bug fixes/new features take much longer than anticipated, ripple effects. Projects with test coverage usually fare better, but tend to have similar issues.

What did all these projects have in common? - low internal quality

## What is Internal Quality?

1. Let's define internal quality. It's the quality of software design/architecture that enables change
1. It's not just about unit tests either
1. It's not just about following SOLID or implementing design patterns

internal quality describes how well the structure of the code enables change.

## Erosion

1. Why does code quality deteriorate over time?
1. Code quality always deteriorates in a living project

## Not too Much, Not too Little

1. The cost of over-designing. naturally developers try to do every thing right
1. Cost over-designing and finding the right balance

1. Introduction bla bla
1. Why is internal quality hard to achieve?
1. Why is it hard to teach internal quality?
1. Idea of frequency of change
1. Frequently combined with bad infrastructure or insufficient or absent build processes
